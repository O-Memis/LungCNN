# LungCNN
 PyTorch CNN model implementation to classify pulmonary diseases in chest X-ray dataset.

<br><br><br>



**CODE ORGANIZATION:**

    This code is a well documented CNN application via Pytorch library.
    The codes are separated into 4 different cells with total 17 steps.
    Read the descriptions and run the codes cell by cell. 
    You can also run the whole code at once, if you want.
    
    The steps are as follows:
        
        1) Inspect the image attributes
        2) Pytorch CNN model:
                             # 1. Processing Unit Selection
                             # 2. Define and change Hyperparameters
                             # 3. Define a data preprocessing tool
                             # 4. Dataset loading via applying transformations
                             # 5. Data split ratios
                             # 6. Train-test splitting
                             # 7. Data loader functions
                             # 8. Model Definitions
                             # 9. The Loss function
                             # 10. The optimization selection
                             # 11. Initialize metric tracking lists
                             # 12. Training and testing loops
                             # 13. Visualization of metrics
    
        3) Save the model
        4) Load and use the model
